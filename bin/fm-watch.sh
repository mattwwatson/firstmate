# Firstmate watcher.
# Classifies supervision wakes in bash. In normal mode it absorbs benign wakes
# and keeps blocking; it queues and exits only for actionable wakes.
# The no-verb signal and stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: a wake
# is absorbed only when the crew shows POSITIVE evidence it is still working (an
# actively-running no-mistakes step, or a backend busy signal), and surfaced
# otherwise, so a crew that finishes (or stops and waits) without a current
# working signal is never silently swallowed. A declared external-wait pause is
# the separate idle absorb case and re-surfaces only on its long bounded cadence,
# although its initial no-verb status signal still surfaces in normal mode.
# While state/.afk exists, the daemon owns triage and this watcher queues and exits
# on every wake. Printed reason lines:
#   signal: <file>...      status/turn-end signals, surfaced when a listed status
#                          has a captain-relevant verb OR a no-verb signal's crew
#                          is not provably working, unless afk is active
#   stale: <window>        a provably-working stale is ALWAYS absorbed (with a wedge
#                          timer) regardless of what the status log says - an active
#                          run-step or busy pane outranks even a captain-relevant log
#                          line, since the crew's own log gets no new entry once
#                          firstmate hands it to a no-mistakes validation. A declared
#                          external-wait pause is absorbed instead with its own long
#                          re-surface cadence, never as a wedge; a live agent behind
#                          that pause still surfaces ONCE, labeled as the declared
#                          pause it is. Only when neither absorb class applies does
#                          the log's last line decide: terminal (captain-relevant)
#                          or non-terminal (no verb), both surfaced at once. A
#                          provably-working stale past the wedge threshold also
#                          surfaces, with an "escalation N" count in the reason; at
#                          FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT consecutive escalations on
#                          the SAME pane, the reason also carries a
#                          "demand-deep-inspection" marker so the wake payload
#                          itself, not just repetition, forces a closer look
#                          instead of another routine supervision resume. Repeat
#                          escalations require NEW evidence: the crew state is

#                          FM_WEDGE_ESCALATE_MAX_SECS) and a changed one escalates
#                          at once, while a read that FAILED is no evidence at all
#                          and neither escalates nor advances the ladder.

#
# An escalation must be driven by EVIDENCE, not by another turn of the clock.
# Elapsed pane-quiet time alone cannot tell a wedged crew from a legitimately
# long quiet step: a single-command validation step routinely runs 15-45 minutes
# in this repo with nothing rendered in the pane, and re-escalating it every
# STALE_ESCALATE_SECS produced four identical "possible wedge" alarms - three of
# them demanding manual inspection - for a crew that was healthy every time
# (2026-07-21). So once per STALE_ESCALATE_SECS this re-reads the ONE
# authoritative verdict (crew_absorb_class, the same bounded read the first
# sighting made) and records it in .wedge-probe-<key>, whose mtime doubles as
# the probe schedule:
#   - verdict CHANGED since the last probe (including the first probe of a
#     stale hash, which is what makes the first escalation land at exactly
#     STALE_ESCALATE_SECS as before): escalate now, because that is new
#     information the supervisor does not have;
#   - verdict UNCHANGED: escalate only once the backed-off window
#     (wedge_escalate_interval) has passed, because repeating the same evidence
#     tells the supervisor nothing it was not told last time.
# A probe is only evidence when the read SUCCEEDED. crew_absorb_class reports
# `unreadable` for a state read that failed (timeout, contention, an unresolvable
# task id), which says nothing at all about the crew: it must not advance the
# ladder, must not bypass the backed-off window, and must never be reported as a
# lost work signal. It only re-arms the probe schedule, so the next window gets a
# fresh attempt without re-reading on every poll. But "no evidence" must never
# become "no alarm, ever": a reader that stays broken (missing binary, fork
# failure, a permanent timeout) would otherwise blind the wedge detector for that
# window forever, trading a false alarm for a missed real one. So consecutive
# unreadable probes are counted in .wedge-unreadable-<key>, and once
# WEDGE_UNREADABLE_SURFACE_COUNT of them pile up the window surfaces on its OWN
# terms - the reason says the state could not be READ and names the reader, and
# asserts neither a wedge nor a stop, because neither has been established.
# Repeats of that surfacing carry the same evidence as the first, so they are
# spaced by the SAME backoff the escalation ladder uses (wedge_escalate_interval,
# capped by WEDGE_ESCALATE_MAX_SECS), counted in .wedge-unreadable-surfaced-<key>
# whose mtime is the anchor: a reader that stays broken keeps waking the
# supervisor at a widening interval rather than nagging on a fixed one. Both
# counts are dropped the moment any readable verdict arrives. A `paused` verdict is not a
# stopped crew either - the crew declared an external wait, so the pane is handed
# to the bounded pause cadence (handle_paused_stale) instead of escalated.
# Nothing is suppressed: every escalation still fires, the escalation ladder and
# its demand-deep-inspection marker are unchanged, and a crew that stops looking
# like it is working is surfaced at the next probe rather than at the backed-off
# window.
# The unreadable half of a probe, kept whole so the caller's only job is to hand
# the verdict over and stop: nothing after the wake belongs to this path, and
# nothing here may fall through into the readable bookkeeping (which would record
# `unreadable` as if it were evidence). Counts this failed read, and either
# absorbs it as no new information or surfaces the reader failure once its

# Behavior tests for per-project delivery mode and independent autonomy grants.
#
# The regression this file exists for: `+yolo` used to be ONE boolean covering
# three distinct grants (answering review findings, merging PRs, approving a
# local-only merge). A captain who wanted "you may answer PR questions, I merge
# PRs" had no registry input that said so, so the instruction survived only as
# prose in a description. test_findings_grant_is_independent_of_merge pins the
# fix: the two grants must be settable one without the other.

  Agent-only handling playbook for session-start bootstrap diagnostics.
  Use whenever the session-start digest's bootstrap section prints an actionable diagnostic line - MISSING, MISSING_MANUAL, BACKEND_INVALID, NEEDS_GH_AUTH, FORGE_CREDENTIAL, TANGLE, CREW_DISPATCH invalid, FLEET_SYNC, PR_CHECK_MIGRATION, SECONDMATE_SYNC, SECONDMATE_LIVENESS, NUDGE_SECONDMATES, or FMX - or when a standalone bin/fm-bootstrap.sh run prints one of those lines.
  A silent bootstrap section, or a BOOTSTRAP_INFO fact, means no skill load.

# bootstrap-diagnostics

Handle each printed line as below, before dispatching work that depends on it.
The line formats themselves are owned by `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`'s header; this playbook owns the response to actionable lines.
The inline rules in `AGENTS.md` section 3 still bind: detect, then consent, then install - never install anything the captain has not approved in this session - and no work is dispatched until the tools it needs are present and GitHub auth is good.
When any diagnostic needs captain attention, report the plain consequence and requested action using `AGENTS.md` section 9's captain-facing translation contract; do not name the diagnostic label unless the captain needs to paste it into a command or issue.

- `MISSING: <tool> (install: <command>)` - list the missing tools to the captain with a one-line purpose each plus the printed install commands, wait for consent (one approval may cover the list), then run `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh install <approved tools...>`.
  For `treehouse`, this also covers an installed version whose `treehouse get` lacks `--lease`; treat it as an upgrade request.
  For `no-mistakes`, this also covers an installed version older than 1.31.2, because crewmate validation briefs delegate gate mechanics to no-mistakes' version-matched guidance.
  For `tasks-axi`, this also covers an installed build that fails the compatibility probe (`docs/configuration.md` "Backlog backend" owns the definition); `config/backlog-backend=manual` only suppresses the verbose `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: tasks-axi available` fact, not this missing-tool report.
  For `quota-axi`, bootstrap requires it because every crew-dispatch profile array calls it automatically; `bin/fm-dispatch-select.sh` still selects uniformly from valid candidates with OS-backed randomness when quota data is unavailable.
- `MISSING_MANUAL: <tool> (instructions: <url>)` - tell the captain why the tool is required and give them the printed instructions URL, but do not pass the tool to `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh install`; wait for the captain to complete the manual installation, then rerun session start to confirm the dependency is present.
- `BACKEND_INVALID: <name> (known: <names>)` - the resolved runtime backend has no verified dependency or lifecycle contract, so do not dispatch work until the invalid `FM_BACKEND` or `config/backend` value is corrected to one of the listed backends.
- `NEEDS_GH_AUTH` - ask the captain to run `! gh auth login` (interactive; you cannot run it for them).
- `FORGE_CREDENTIAL: <forge>: <reason>` - this home tracks a repository on a forge whose credential firstmate holds itself, and that credential cannot be used, so merge detection and build results for every repository on that forge are unavailable until it is fixed.
  The reason names the failing requirement only, never a credential value, and never quote a credential back to the captain or ask them to paste one into chat.
  An absent or empty entry means the captain must create or re-cache it; a rejected credential means it was revoked, expired, or was created without the read scopes firstmate needs; a store read that did not answer in time means the stored item is raising a confirmation dialog no unattended session can answer, so it must be re-cached to allow an unattended read.
  "cannot see <forge> repository <repo>" means the credential authenticated and the forge then refused to admit that repository exists, which does NOT say whose fault it is.
  Scope refusal would have arrived as its own HTTP 403 line, so the live possibilities are a credential bound to the wrong account, a credential that has lost access to that specific private repository, or a repository that was renamed or moved.
  Check those in that order: confirm which account the keychain entry belongs to, then confirm the captain still has access to the named repository, then confirm the repository still lives at the path the clone's origin remote gives.
  "no credential store on this platform" is news, not a fault: this machine has no login keychain to read, that forge's merge and build checks are simply unavailable here, and there is nothing for the captain to retry.
  Both of those two are reported once per home and then stay silent, so report each plainly and move on, and do not treat a later silence as the problem having been fixed.
  The not-visible record is kept per probed repository, so a line naming a different repository later is fresh news reported in its own right rather than a repeat, while the no-store record is per forge because it names no repository.
  A lock-refused session reports them without recording them, so the same line arriving again in the session that holds the lock is the expected handover, not a regression.
  `bin/fm-forge-credential.sh`'s header owns the entry names, the required scopes, and the exit-code contract - read it before advising the captain, and tell them the consequence and the action rather than the diagnostic label.
  Firstmate cannot create or store the credential itself, so this always ends in a captain action; work that does not touch that forge continues normally.
- `TANGLE: <remediation>` - the primary checkout is stranded on a feature branch instead of its default branch; `AGENTS.md` section 8 explains why this guard exists and what it protects.
  The work is safe on that branch ref; restore the primary to its default branch with the printed `git -C <root> checkout <default>`, then re-validate that branch in a proper worktree.
  This is the only sanctioned firstmate-initiated git write to the primary, and it is a non-destructive branch switch that strands nothing.
- `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json - <reason>` - the optional dispatch profile file exists but failed low-cost bootstrap validation; continue with the normal fallback chain, resolve and pass the chosen fallback harness explicitly while the file remains present, fix the malformed schema, unverified harness name, unknown selector, or invalid harness/effort pair when convenient, and do not select a bad profile.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: skipped: <reason>` - a benign one-off skip (offline, no origin, local-only); bootstrap continued, investigate only if it blocks work.
  A skip can also report the bounded fleet-refresh timeout (`FM_FLEET_SYNC_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT`, or a fleet-size-aware default with a 20 second floor); a timeout never blocks startup.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: recovered: <detail>` - the clone had drifted onto a clean detached HEAD holding no unique commits and the sync self-healed it (re-attached the default branch and fast-forwarded); no action needed, it is reported only so the self-heal is visible.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: STUCK: on <state>, N commits behind <base> - needs attention` - the clone is dirty, on a non-default branch, detached with unique commits, or diverged, so the sync left it untouched (never forcing or discarding); it will keep falling behind until you look.
  A loud STUCK, especially a growing N across bootstraps, means that clone needs hands-on attention; dispatch a crewmate or resolve it before it strands work.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: canonical polls rebuilt and armed; resume supervision for this home` - the non-executing migration rebuilt canonical task polls from validated metadata, and those polls are already armed.
  Independently verify the private per-task outcome record, then resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: validated replacement polls armed; resume supervision for this home` - a retry proved canonical publication provenance, metadata identity binding, and single-link integrity for a replacement poll resolving an earlier ambiguous migration outcome.
  Independently verify the private per-task outcome record, then resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: quarantined polls remain unarmed; review state/.pr-check-migration.log before rearming` - one or more ambiguous or invalid task polls were quarantined without execution and remain unarmed.
  Read the private mode-`0600` per-task outcome record, verify the task's recorded PR independently, and rearm only through `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` with canonical inputs.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: migration completed safely; resume supervision for this home` - migration crossed the update boundary without rebuilding or quarantining a task poll after pausing the prior watcher.
  Resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- Any other `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION:` refusal means migration did not complete safely, whether because watcher exclusion, a private path, a diagnostic, quarantine validation, or marker publication could not be proved.
  Keep each affected poll unavailable, inspect the named private state path, and do not bypass the migration or execute a quarantined artifact; a completed safe-scan marker allows unrelated authenticated polls to continue while private repair remains pending.
- `SECONDMATE_SYNC: secondmate <id>: skipped: <reason>` - the local-HEAD secondmate sync left a live secondmate home on its existing checkout because the home was dirty, diverged, unsafe, on the wrong branch, missing the primary target commit, or otherwise not fast-forwardable, or because inherited local-material propagation failed; bootstrap continued, but inspect the reason because the secondmate's tracked instructions, inherited settings, or shared captain preferences may be stale after a primary update.
- `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS: secondmate <id>: skipped: <reason>|respawn failed after <cause>: <reason>` - the session-start liveness sweep could not guarantee that the registered secondmate is running a real agent process.
  Investigate the reason because that secondmate is not guaranteed live.
- `NUDGE_SECONDMATES: secondmate <id>: send failed: <reason>` - the secondmate sweep fast-forwarded a running secondmate home and its loaded instruction surface (`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, or `.agents/skills/`) changed, but the deterministic `fm-send.sh fm-<id>` re-read nudge failed.
  Inspect the reason, keep the pending marker under `state/.secondmate-nudge-pending/` intact, and rerun session start after the endpoint or metadata issue is fixed so bootstrap can retry the exact same marked send.
- `FMX: X mode on ...` / `FMX: X mode off ...` - bootstrap confirmed or removed the local X-mode poll artifacts (`docs/configuration.md` "X mode (.env)").
  Only when a running watcher needs the cadence transition applied immediately, restart the home-scoped watcher through the emitted harness supervision protocol; bootstrap deliberately never restarts the watcher itself.
